Over the years, I have been asked for the titles and artists for particular songs within Obsoleet episodes. I have gone ahead and compiled a list of all the independent music from the show, all created by [Moonlit][1] under his musical project [Byte Garden][2]. There are a few bits of music that aren't done by Moonlit and are simply in the episodes because those are the only examples I had to work with for a specific physical medium. These examples are not included in the list.

Somewhat coincidentally, Moonlit has released two new Byte Garden albums this week ([Cathode Lounge][3] and [Sound Tracker][4]), full of brand new music he has been working on for some time. Feel free to check out his entire catalog, and download any and all of his music for free.
