So Iâ€™m sure many of you know my work with the [IPTV Archive][1], and in a similar idea a new site called [IPTV Torrents][2] has officially launched **today**. This project is spearheaded by Corrosion of [DeAuthThis][3], secret52 of [Hak.5 torrents][4], as well as myself. The site is a cross between a public and private torrent site. While you can download torrents without registering, the real fun comes when you become a member. You can upload content, comment on torrents, search for lost shows, and become part of the community!

The idea for the site came around a month ago, and quickly went into a closed testing period. After it proved stable enough, it was expanded to a closed beta and has been so until today, where it is now completely public.

IPTV Torrents offers great potential. Not only can it be a great service for finding older, lost iptv shows, but can also be a great resource for newer ones. Why wade through dozens of pages of download links when you can click one and be done? It can even act as a launch pad for show creators to share their content, talk with other creators, and get connected with potential viewers.

Though the site is still in its early stages, and a bit rough around the edges, it needs all the support it can get. If you think it might interest you, [check it out][2]. We are open to all ideas, criticism, and compliments.Feel free to use all aspects of the site, and show your support through the IRC, Twitter, or Facebook page if you desire.

Happy IPTVing.
