I successfully got iTunes working by creating a little wordpress blog to post .mp4 files to that are generated by archive.org when I upload the Xvid, the link to get the show on iTunes is here, <http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/obsoleet/id378988732>

I also found out a little bit ago that Blip.tv does Miro for me as well. The Miro link can be found here, <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http://Obsoleet.blip.tv/rss>

If Odeo ever comes back on line, I'll be sure to setup something with that service as well. Back five years ago, Democracy Player and Fireant were the two big video distribution applications, and they have, over the years, become Miro and Odeo respectively. It would be a shame to only have one. Enjoy the new services!
