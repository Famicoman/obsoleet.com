As I start pre-production on Season 2, I went and updated some of Obsoleet’s more social platforms.

~~There is now a Google Plus page located at, <https://plus.google.com/109504373189656584477/posts>~~

~~The Facebook page now has a permanent address here, <https://www.facebook.com/Obsoleet>~~

The Twitter page as always, <https://twitter.com/#!/obsoleettv>

~~I’ve also set up Obsoleet with the micro-donation platform Flattr here, <http://flattr.com/thing/500710/Obsoleet> as well as Bitcoin which you can find on the Donation page.~~

Got any suggestions on how to bring Obsoleet into more of a social scene? Contact me and let me know.
