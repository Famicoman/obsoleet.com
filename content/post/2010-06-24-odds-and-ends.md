Thought that I’d share a section of Archive.org which I use to store miscellaneous stuff for the show. Some makes it into an episode, some doesn’t; it is really a mixed bag. Inside you will find the show’s theme song, an earlier version of the theme song, and the VHS Disasterpiece video. More stuff will be coming, and if it is interesting enough, I’ll probably make a post about it. That said, some other stuff may make it onto the archive that never shows up anywhere else, so keep your eyes open.
