So I've been neglecting season two for a little while and though I put some feelers out there for it, I decided to make a big post and officially get the wheels moving. Now that I've finished off most of my video side projects, I can focus back on the show.

However, there are some things to consider and some questions I have for you all, the viewers.

Let me start off by saying that the last few months have been anything but a waste. I have the big honkin' computer, bought some new gear, and have been clearing away data from my crowded camera SD cards and hard drives. I made some short videos, I made a segment for The New Tech, and I've been getting pretty decent at going high-def. It's exciting times. That said, I wanted to start working steadily on season two last month but hit a temporary setback. It'll make a good blog post one day, but not now. We have important work to do after all.

So while I've been toiling away in my mad scientist's laboratory of technology, I've been thinking of where I want to take this new season. All of my previous content was filmed on standard definition tape which won't cut it very nicely for this new-fangled high definition format I've adopted. For starters, I want to do a new intro. So, if you happen to do any sort of graphics work and do animation or 3D rendering or anything like that and would like to contribute something, let me know. Maybe you have a 12 second rotation around an old Western Electric telephone done in Inventor or (like Pat) are doing some interesting video output work with an Arduino. If there's anything you think would fit in, you know how to get a hold of me.

I'm also interested in what you guys want to see. Is the format working? Do you like the reviews? Are there specific segments that you think I could do or would like to see? Yeah, I get some requests now and then, but not as many as you'd think. Are you interested in more "meta" segments, like how I make the show or a tour of the things I have? Stuff like that.

I'm open to all of your ideas, every which way. Let your imaginations run wild.

Hope to see you in season two.
