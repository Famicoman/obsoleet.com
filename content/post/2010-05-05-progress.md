Well, the show is getting off to a pretty good start. One segment was filmed, &#8220;The Lineman's Handset.&#8221; If you want to check it out, drop into the chat and ask for a link. The next segment to be filmed is &#8220;Podcasting on the Cheap&#8221; which will hopefully be completed this weekend. I also have some more ideas revolving around telephony which I hope to get out of the way soon.

Also, Moonlit was kind enough to make a theme song, which can be found <a href="http://ia331203.us.archive.org/1/items/Obsoleet/ObsoleetTheme--Final.mp3" title="ObsoleetTheme--Final.mp3" target="_blank">here</a> on archive.org. More of Moonlit's music can be found at <a href="http://bgaaudio.org/" title="BGA" target="_blank">Byte Garden Audio</a>. This intro theme has given me some ideas for a video intro, but making that work is going to take some time. Segment filming is going to take top priority, but an intro sequence is not far behind.
