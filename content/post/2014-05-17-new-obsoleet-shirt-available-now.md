While the third episode of season two is still caught up in the early stages of production, I am happy to announce that I have reworked the old Obsoleet shirt design to be something a little more permanent. The old design featured the old site URL, which changed ages ago. The new shirt features the show's slogan: "Where Old Technology Goes to Live" in the fitting Data 70 font. The shirt is available at the [Noobelodeon Store][1] in men's sizes S - XXL. Check it out!
