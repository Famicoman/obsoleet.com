<span>For the blip.tv account, it has come to my attention that Obsoleet needs some new graphics in the following dimensions: 540&#215;800, 980&#215;400, 220&#215;150. Instead of adapt my same old design, I am posing it to the community to see if anyone can come up with anything else, and have their work showcased on the page (and anywhere else I feel like). I may also adapt designs for shirts later on down the line.<br /> </span>

So if it catches your fancy, fire up Photoshop or Gimp and let me see what you can come up with!
