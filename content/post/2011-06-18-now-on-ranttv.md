Obsoleet is now on RantTV, the oldest Internet television station! If you used to be big into the iptv scene, Rant will ring a few bells. Not only did they have a video stream of popular web-only shows, but also produced their own video shows featuring Sean Kennedy.

Every episode of Obsoleet is now included in the rotation, and if you tune in to the stream, you can view awesome content from other members of the RantMedia community.
