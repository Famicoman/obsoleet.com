Two weeks ago, I released the first Obsoleet episode in two years. It's been a long time coming and I simply cannot believe so much time has gone by since that last episode of season one hit the internet. A lot has changed since then and if you followed my sporadic posts over the last two years, you'll know I picked up some new gear and new goodies along the way. 

If you haven't already seen the new episode, take a minute and check it out. I hoped to give the same old Obsoleet feel with my new equipment, and think that the resulting episode came out nicely. There are still things that I need to work on, and am always working on. My biggest problems have always been sound and lighting, and I aim to work on those as much as possible. I've received mostly positive reviews of this past episode, but am always working to improve my previous attempts. Additionally, I admit the last episode was a little light on the content, but I wanted to get out what I could and create some momentum to keep me going even further. If you read my last update, you will know that in addition to the floppy segment from this past episode, I was also working on a [Raspberry Pi][1] based segment. Well&#8230; I accidentally threw out some of the video I took. Not a big deal as I can recreate it, but it definitely set me back. I hope to push out segments quickly and completely and make sure nothing stays on the back burner for too long.

As for my next segments, I can say that I am working on completing this Raspberry Pi fueled segment and have a few more Raspberry Pi segments coming up behind. I also have some other segments in the works, but I've been very RPi focused over the past few weeks and enjoy the interesting, though tedious, challenges that come with the platform.

Additionally, I've been working to try to revive some of the services I utilize for the show. Donations have now been expanded, and Dogecoin (as well as your other favorite cryptocurrencies) is now accepted aside from traditional donation services. These changes are reflected on the Donations page as well as a new widget on the left side of the screen. Social networking sites should also see some minor tweaks, and I do hope to redo the iTunes feed. Things are progressing fairly well, and I hope to bring out another episode soon.

As always, feel free to send me your questions, comments, concerns, or episode ideas. I've already got a few of each but always consider every bit of feedback I get.

I hope you're enjoying season two as much as I am so far. See you next episode!
