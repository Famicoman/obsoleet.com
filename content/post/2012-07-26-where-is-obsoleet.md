I haven't made a new episode in a while. I apologize for that. Let's talk about what has happened in the interim.

Episode eight came out in February, and I released a [short test video][1] a month after with my new camera. In the month of April, I started working on a short documentary, but here is where the snags started. What it really comes down to is my computer being unable to handle editing high definition video. I edited together the footage from the first shoot after a few days, but trying to do anything more than splice clips is next to impossible. I can't color correct without crashing, precision editing cannot be done with choppy video, and I barely have enough resources to run my editing software yet alone any other applications.

Let's step aside from this for a minute.

In early May, I started the [SaveRev3][2] project. I actually hinted at this in Obsoleet as an un-named project. Anyways, with the the help of others I have archived all of Revision3's &#8220;Archived Shows&#8221; including ones they removed from their site. A nice accomplishment if you ask me. On top of this, I started a new website for the project called [Anarchivism][3]. Anarchivism is an ad-hoc/umbrella/do-ocracy destination for archiving projects which has already expanded past the Revision3 efforts to cover other video shows, audio shows, hacker conference media, and demoscene discs. With any luck, it will only get larger.

Aside from this, I have been writing more. A lot more. I have been keeping SaveRev3 status updates, general reviews, editorials, etc. and it has given a new spark to my old habits. Aside from writing for my own site, I have also been contributing articles to [The New Tech][4], a wonderful video podcast and community-oriented site.

This leads in to what's next. I had originally thought about releasing short one-segment videos to pass the time before I build a brand new computer with all the bells and whistles (Which I'm starting early August). Instead of doing these one-off segments for Obsoleet, I got the idea to contribute them to other shows. I am planning on creating segments for both The New Tech and [BSOD][5] in the near future before starting season 2 of Obsoleet. This way, I can still make video while getting my computer together, and have some of the editing responsibilities split with others.

I also plan on branching back out into audio. The New Tech is planning a weekly radio radio show that I hope to be involved with in some capacity. I am also planning an episode of Hacker Public Radio, which has been on the to-do list since before it was even called [Hacker Public Radio][6] (TWAT represent!). In addition to all of this, I've been considering revamping [Techtat][7] so that it has its own podcast in addition to the articles.

So where are we exactly with Obsoleet? Season 2 will pick up after I build an editing rig. Plain and simple. In the mean time, I'll produce content for other shows, so you can still get your fix. As a little bonus, I've recently registered [obsoleet.com][8] (which I've been waiting to be free since starting the show) and have migrated the site over there (Update your bookmarks). It still needs some work, but it's getting there bit by bit.

As always, let me know what you think. If you have any additional ideas, suggestions, or gripes, you know how to find me.
