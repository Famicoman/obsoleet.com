Obsoleet was the final step in a long struggle to start what is not called a video podcast, but was then called an  IPTV show. With the initial ideas brewing since 2006, Obsoleet broke out in the Summer of 2010. This show was basically about taking something and using it in a new way. Mainly focusing on older technologies, the show had no set format. That said, Obsoleet was your regular dose of video-captured hackery from one geek to another.

The show released its final episode in 2014.

[Famicoman][1] was the writer/editor/director/star/producer for the show. If it's old and it's tech, he knows about it.

[Moonlit][2] provided the majority of the music for the show, from the snappy theme song to the bits of audio used in segments and transitions.

Obsoleet was in streaming rotation on [RantTV][3] and [ChannelEM][4]. It probably still is streaming on RantTV today provided the streams are still live. 

Obsoleet epsiode releases were syndicated on [TheNewTech.tv][5] and [Philly 2600][6].
